<!-- LLM: This document explains how the system is designed to meet the requirements
(2-REQUIREMENTS.md). Read the prior docs first so the architecture clearly serves the
requirements and experiences. Interview the user about the actual or intended design — don't
invent components. Where a significant choice was made between alternatives, record it as an
ADR in 3-ENGINEERING/ADRs/ and link to it here rather than arguing the decision inline.
Remove LLM comments as you fill each section. -->

# Architecture

<!-- LLM: One-paragraph overview of the system shape (e.g. "a single-binary CLI", "a web app
with a Postgres backend"). Give the reader the mental model before the detail. -->

_What kind of system is this, in one paragraph?_

## Context diagram

<!-- LLM: Show the system in its environment — its users and the external systems it talks to.
A simple ASCII/Mermaid diagram or a bullet list of "actor → system → external service" is
fine. Ask the user what's inside the boundary vs. outside it. -->

```
_actor_ → [ this system ] → _external service_
```

## Components

<!-- LLM: Break the system into its major parts. For each, state its single responsibility and
what it depends on. Ask the user to walk through the pieces; capture one row per component.
Keep responsibilities crisp — if a component does "everything", probe to split it. -->

| Component | Responsibility | Depends on |
|---|---|---|
| _Name_ | _What it owns_ | _Other components / services_ |

## Data model

<!-- LLM: Describe the key entities and their relationships, or the main data structures /
state. Link to a schema file if one exists. Ask: "What are the nouns the system stores or
passes around, and how do they relate?" Remove if the system is essentially stateless. -->

_Key entities and relationships._

## Key flows

<!-- LLM: Trace 1-3 important paths through the system end-to-end (e.g. the main request, the
main command). Number the steps and name the components involved. These should line up with
the key experiences in 1-EXPERIENCES.md. -->

### _Flow name_

1. _Step — which component_
2. _Step — which component_

## Cross-cutting concerns

<!-- LLM: How the design handles concerns that span components: error handling, logging,
configuration, auth/security, performance, observability. Ask the user which of these apply
and how they're addressed. Drop the ones that don't apply. -->

- **Error handling:** _…_
- **Configuration:** _…_
- **Security:** _…_
- **Observability:** _…_

## Decisions

<!-- LLM: List the significant architectural decisions, each linking to its ADR. Do not
re-argue them here. If no ADRs exist yet, prompt the user: "What were the big either/or
choices? Each deserves an ADR." Use `docgen add adr <slug>` to create one. -->

- _[ADR-0001 — short title](3-ENGINEERING/ADRs/0001-*.md)_

## Risks & trade-offs

<!-- LLM: Capture where the design is knowingly weak or where a trade-off was accepted, and
why. Honest risk-listing here saves pain later. -->

- _Risk / trade-off — mitigation or rationale_
